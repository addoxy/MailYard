This document outlines all development tasks needed to complete the email builder application, organized by frontend and backend components.

## Frontend Tasks

This section contains all client-side development tasks for the email builder interface, organized by development phases.

### Phase 1: Core Functionality

#### 1. Home Page Foundation

- [x] Create `src/app/home/page.tsx` - Main gallery page with responsive layout
- [x] Create `src/app/home/components/design-gallery.tsx` - Grid view for design cards
- [x] Create `src/app/home/components/sidebar-navigation.tsx` - Left sidebar with sections
- [x] Create `src/app/home/components/search-filter-bar.tsx` - Search and filter controls
- [x] Create `src/app/home/hooks/use-design-data.ts` - Mock design data management
- [x] Create `src/app/home/hooks/use-design-filters.ts` - Filter and sorting logic
- [x] Create `src/app/home/atoms.ts` - Home page state management
- [x] Implement search functionality with real-time filtering
- [x] Implement sorting filters:
  - Alphabetical order (A-Z, Z-A)
  - Last modified (newest/oldest first)
  - Date created (newest/oldest first)

**Notes**: Start with mock data for designs. Focus on responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile. Include all filter options from requirements.

#### 2. Email Builder Basic Layout

- [x] Update `src/app/designs/[id]/page.tsx` - Implement 3-column resizable layout
- [x] Update `src/app/designs/[id]/components/resource-sidebar.tsx` - Block library foundation
- [x] Update `src/app/designs/[id]/components/email-section.tsx` - Canvas area with header actions
- [x] Update `src/app/designs/[id]/components/inspector-sidebar.tsx` - Style panel foundation
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/hooks/use-email-builder.ts` - Core builder state logic

**Notes**: Focus on layout structure first. Use placeholders for complex functionality.

#### 3. Email Block System Foundation

- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/email-blocks/` directory
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/email-blocks/heading-block.tsx` - Using @react-email/components
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/email-blocks/text-block.tsx` - Using @react-email/components
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/email-blocks/container-block.tsx` - Using @react-email/components
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/email-blocks/types.ts` - Block type definitions
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/email-blocks/block-registry.ts` - Block registration system

**Notes**: CRITICAL - All blocks must use inline styles only, no Tailwind classes. Base all blocks on @react-email/components.

#### 4. Basic Block Library

- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/resource-sidebar/block-library.tsx`
- [x] Implement click-to-add functionality for blocks (adds to bottom of email)
- [x] Create block icons using Lucide React
- [x] Add AtomicTooltip for block descriptions

**Notes**: Start with 3 basic blocks: heading, text, container. More blocks will be added in Phase 2.

#### 5. Basic Block Selection

- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/hooks/use-block-selection.ts` - Single block selection
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/email-section/block-selector.tsx` - Visual selection indicators
- [x] Update email canvas to show selected block with borders/highlighting
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/atoms.ts` - Add selectedBlockId atom
- [x] Make the selected block editable

**Notes**: Focus on single block selection first. Multi-select comes in Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Interactive Editing

#### 6. Block Editing System

- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/inspector-sidebar/block-editor.tsx` - Main block editing interface
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/inspector-sidebar/property-controls/` directory
- [x] Create basic property controls: text content, font size, color, alignment
- [x] Connect inspector sidebar to selected block state from atoms
- [x] Implement real-time block property updates
- [x] Add validation and error handling for property inputs
- [x] Create block type-specific property panels (heading vs text vs container)

**Notes**: Focus on core text properties first. Advanced styling comes in Phase 3. Ensure changes update the email canvas in real-time.

#### 7. Multi-Select and Bulk Editing

- [x] Update `use-block-selection.ts` - Support multi-select with Ctrl/Cmd + click
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/hooks/use-bulk-editing.ts` - Bulk property editing logic
- [x] Update inspector sidebar to handle multi-select state
- [x] Implement "Mixed" state display for different property values

**Notes**: Show "Mixed" when selected blocks have different values for the same property. Build on the block editing system from Task 6.

#### 8. Keyboard Shortcuts

- [x] Create `src/hooks/use-keyboard-shortcuts.ts` - Global keyboard shortcut manager
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/hooks/use-email-shortcuts.ts` - Email builder specific shortcuts
- [x] Implement shortcuts: Delete, Select All, Duplicate, Copy/Paste, Arrow navigation

**Notes**: Use global hook for app-wide shortcuts, feature-specific hook for email builder shortcuts. Undo/Redo moved to separate task.

#### 9. Drag & Drop System

- [x] Install and configure dnd-kit
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/hooks/use-drag-drop.ts` - Drag and drop logic
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/email-section/drag-drop-handler.tsx` - D&D component
- [x] Implement block reordering within email canvas

**Notes**: Use dnd-kit for all drag-and-drop. Add subtle animations for better UX.

#### 10. Complete Block Library

- [x] Create the image block
- [x] Make the image block support rendering the image from a provided link.
- [x] Update block registry with all block types
- [x] Add drag-from-library functionality (drag block to specific position)
- [x] Implement block categories/grouping in resource sidebar

**Notes**: Each block must use @react-email/components as foundation with inline styles only.

#### 11. Block List and Reordering System

- [x] Remove the assets section from the resource sidebar
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/resource-sidebar/block-list.tsx` - Show list of blocks in email canvas
- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/resource-sidebar/block-list-item.tsx` - Individual block list item component
- [x] Implement drag-and-drop reordering functionality for the block list using dnd-kit
- [x] Add visual indicators for drag operations (highlighting, insertion points)
- [x] Ensure block list updates reflect in real-time on the email canvas
- [x] Add block selection from the list (clicking a list item selects the block in canvas)
- [x] Display block names/types clearly with appropriate icons

**Notes**: This replaces the asset management with a more useful block outline/layers panel. Focus on smooth drag-and-drop reordering that syncs with the canvas. Use the existing drag-drop infrastructure.

### Phase 3: Export & Preview Systems

#### 12. Advanced Style Inspector Panel

- [x] Update `src/app/designs/[id]/components/inspector-sidebar/style-controls/` directory
- [x] Update advanced typography controls: letter spacing
- [x] Ensure all default styles are uniform and sensible across all blocks
- [x] Convert all distance-related styles to use px units only (inputs should be numbers, not strings like "20px")

**Notes**: This updates the existing property controls from Task 6. All distance inputs should be numeric only, internally converted to px.

#### 13. Fix Default Font Weight Bug

- [x] Fix heading blocks to show proper default font weight (should be bold/600 for headings)
- [x] Fix text blocks to show proper default font weight (should be normal/400 for text)
- [x] Ensure font weight property controls display the correct current values
- [x] Update block type definitions to include proper default font weights
- [x] Increase white spacing in the inspector sidebar for better readability and visual breathing room

**Notes**: Currently heading and text blocks are not showing any default font weight. This makes headings appear the same as regular text, which is incorrect. Also improve the visual spacing in the inspector sidebar.

#### 14. Fix Canvas Font Family Inheritance Bug

- [x] Fix the page-level font family selector to actually apply font-family changes to the canvas
- [x] Implement font-family inheritance system where blocks inherit the canvas font-family by default
- [x] Only override inherited font-family when a block has its own font-family explicitly set
- [x] Ensure the canvas font-family updates are reflected in real-time across all blocks
- [x] Test that individual block font-family overrides still work correctly

**Notes**: Currently the font family selector in the page doesn't change the font-family of blocks. Blocks should inherit the canvas font-family unless they have their own font-family specified.

#### 15. Preview System

- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/email-section/preview-modal.tsx`
- [x] Implement email client preview tabs: Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, Yahoo
- [x] Add desktop/mobile preview toggle within modal
- [x] Use @react-email/render for generating preview HTML

**Notes**: Modal should show how email renders across different providers.

#### 16. Export Functionality

- [x] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/email-section/export-modal.tsx`
- [x] Implement React export: clean @react-email/components code generation
- [x] Implement HTML export using @react-email/render with pretty() function
- [x] Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for both exports

**Notes**: Ensure exported code maintains inline styling for email compatibility.

### Phase 4: Styling & UX Enhancement

#### 17. Bug Fixes and Refinements

- [x] Update Container padding controls to have separate x and y padding fields instead of single field
- [x] Convert max-width input to number input (px values only)
- [x] Add more max-width select options and order from smallest to largest
- [x] Remove heading level control from heading blocks
- [x] Fix number inputs in inspector sidebar to allow clearing values without auto-assigning defaults
- [x] Fix button margin display to show outside selected box (like other elements)
- [x] Fix top margin effect threshold (currently only works after 16px)
- [x] Prevent button and link elements from opening new pages when clicked
- [x] Change "text alignment" to "alignment" for button and image blocks (aligning whole element, not just text)

**Notes**: These are critical UX improvements and bug fixes identified during testing. Focus on making controls more intuitive and consistent across all block types.

#### 18. Block Editing and Styling Enhancements

- [x] Make button and link text editable directly in the block (remove link URL editing from block). It should look like I am editing the block itself and not some other input.
- [x] Fix margins and padding not working properly for the link block
- [x] Audit and fix link block properties - many properties don't seem to be working correctly
- [x] Add text decoration controls (underline, strikethrough, none) to heading, text, button, and link blocks
- [x] Add background color support to heading, text, and link blocks
- [x] Add border controls (width, color, style) to heading, text, and link blocks
- [x] Add border radius controls to heading, text, and link blocks
- [x] Update bulk editing to only allow numeric values for distance-based inputs and default to "px" units
- [x] Ensure all block styling is consistent with inline styles for email compatibility

**Notes**: This task focuses on improving the editing experience and adding missing styling options across all text-based blocks. Pay special attention to the link block which seems to have several property issues. All new styling controls must use inline styles only for email client compatibility.

### Phase 5: Code Optimization & Technical Debt

#### 19. Extract Shared Components

- [x] **CRITICAL**: Extract `ClearableNumberInput` component to `/src/components/clearable-number-input.tsx`
  - [x] Remove duplicate implementations from `spacing-controls.tsx`, `border-controls.tsx`, and `typography-controls.tsx`
  - [x] Update all three files to import the shared component
  - [x] Ensure consistent API and behavior across all usages
  - [x] Test that all number inputs still work correctly after extraction

**Impact**: Eliminates 246 lines of duplicated code across 3 files

#### 20. Create Shared Style Utilities

- [x] Create `/src/lib/style-utils.ts` with shared utility functions:
  - [x] `pxToNumber(value: string): number` - Convert "20px" to 20
  - [x] `numberToPx(value: number): string` - Convert 20 to "20px"
  - [x] `validateStyleValue(value: any, type: 'px' | 'color' | 'string'): boolean`
  - [x] `createBaseStyle(props: StyleProps): CSSProperties` - Shared style object construction
- [x] Update `spacing-controls.tsx`, `border-controls.tsx`, and `typography-controls.tsx` to use shared utilities
- [x] Remove duplicate conversion functions from all property control files

**Impact**: Eliminates utility function duplication and standardizes style handling

#### 21. Extract Inline Editing Hook

- [x] Create `/src/hooks/use-inline-editing.ts` hook with shared editing behavior:
  - [x] `handleDoubleClick` - Enter editing mode on double-click
  - [x] `handleSave` - Save changes and exit editing
  - [x] `handleCancel` - Cancel changes and exit editing
  - [x] `handleKeyDown` - Handle Enter (save) and Escape (cancel) keys
  - [x] State management for `isEditing`, `editContent`, auto-focus logic
- [x] Update all block components (`heading-block.tsx`, `text-block.tsx`, `button-block.tsx`, `link-block.tsx`) to use the shared hook
- [x] Remove duplicate editing logic from individual block files
- [x] Ensure consistent editing behavior across all text-based blocks

**Impact**: Eliminates repeated editing patterns and ensures consistent UX

#### 22. Optimize Block Default Styles System

- [x] **Remove redundant default styles from block registry**:
  - [x] Let each block component define its own default styles internally
  - [x] Simplify block registry to only contain metadata (name, icon, description, category)
  - [x] Remove verbose `defaultProps` objects from `block-registry.tsx`
- [x] **Update block components** to define their own defaults:
  - [x] Add `getDefaultProps()` static method or default prop values to each block
  - [x] Ensure consistent default patterns across all blocks
  - [x] Reduce type casting with better TypeScript interfaces
- [x] **Create shared default style patterns**:
  - [x] `createBlockDefaults(overrides: Partial<BlockProps>): BlockProps` utility
  - [x] Consistent spacing, typography, and color defaults across blocks
  - [x] Standardize property naming and units (px vs numbers)

**Impact**: Reduces redundancy in block system and improves maintainability

#### 23. Typography Controls Enhancement & Editing Mode Fixes

- [x] Move text decoration controls from link-specific controls to Typography Controls component
- [x] Ensure text decoration controls (underline, strikethrough, none) are available for all text-based blocks: heading, text, button, and link
- [x] Create reusable text decoration control component within `typography-controls.tsx`
- [x] Remove text decoration logic from link-specific property controls
- [x] Test that text decoration works consistently across all block types
- [x] Ensure text decoration changes are reflected in real-time in the email canvas
- [x] Maintain inline style compatibility for email client support
- [x] **Fix link block editing mode**: Make width full and height grow as typing (use textarea instead of input)
- [x] **Fix button block editing mode**: Prevent characters from being hidden on the left side during typing

**Notes**: Text decorations should be part of the general typography system, not specific to links. This makes the styling system more consistent and allows all text-based blocks to have text decoration options. The editing mode fixes ensure better UX when editing block content inline.

#### 24. Create Reusable Editable Textarea Component

- [x] Create `/src/components/editable-textarea.tsx` - Reusable textarea component for block editing with:
  - [x] Consistent styling across all text-based blocks (heading, text, button, link)
  - [x] Auto-resize functionality using `field-sizing-content` class
  - [x] Proper style inheritance from parent block (font properties, colors, spacing)
  - [x] Standard event handling props: `onBlur`, `onKeyDown`, `onChange`
  - [x] Ref forwarding for focus management
  - [x] Props: `value`, `onChange`, `onBlur`, `onKeyDown`, `style`, `className`, `ref`
- [x] Update all text-based block components to use the shared EditableTextarea:
  - [x] Update `heading-block.tsx` - Replace duplicate textarea with shared component
  - [x] Update `text-block.tsx` - Replace duplicate textarea with shared component
  - [x] Update `button-block.tsx` - Replace duplicate textarea with shared component
  - [x] Update `link-block.tsx` - Replace duplicate textarea with shared component
  - [x] Maintain existing functionality and styling behavior for each block type
  - [x] Ensure proper style inheritance and override patterns work correctly
- [x] Remove all duplicate textarea implementations from individual block files
- [x] Test that editing behavior remains consistent across all block types after refactoring

**Impact**: Eliminates ~60 lines of duplicated textarea code across 4 block components and ensures consistent editing experience.

#### 25. Create Reusable Color Picker Component

- [x] Create `/src/components/color-picker.tsx` - Reusable color picker component with:
  - [x] Color preview square with hover states
  - [x] Hidden HTML color input for browser color picker
  - [x] Text input field for hex color values with validation
  - [x] Consistent styling and behavior across all usages
  - [x] Props: `value`, `onChange`, `label`, `placeholder`, `className`
- [x] Update `color-controls.tsx` to use the shared ColorPicker component:
  - [x] Replace duplicate color picker UI with shared component
  - [x] Maintain existing functionality for text and background colors
  - [x] Ensure proper integration with existing block property system
- [x] Update `border-controls.tsx` to use shared ColorPicker for border color
- [x] Update `canvas-controls.tsx` to use shared ColorPicker for canvas background
- [x] Update `bulk-edit-controls.tsx` to use shared ColorPicker for bulk color editing
- [x] Remove all duplicate color picker implementations across property control files

**Impact**: Eliminates duplicate color picker UI patterns and ensures consistent color selection experience across the application.

#### 26. Integrate createBaseStyle Utility in Email Blocks

- [x] **Update all email block components** to use `createBaseStyle()` from style-utils:
  - [x] Update `heading-block.tsx` - Replace manual baseStyle object with createBaseStyle()
  - [x] Update `text-block.tsx` - Replace manual baseStyle object with createBaseStyle()
  - [x] Update `button-block.tsx` - Replace manual baseStyle object with createBaseStyle()

  - [x] Update `divider-block.tsx` - Replace manual baseStyle object with createBaseStyle()
  - [x] Update `image-block.tsx` - Replace manual style objects with createBaseStyle()
- [x] **Standardize style property handling**:
  - [x] Use consistent prop destructuring patterns across all blocks
  - [x] Handle transparent/default values consistently using createBaseStyle logic
  - [x] Ensure border construction logic is centralized in createBaseStyle
- [x] **Test style functionality** after integration:
  - [x] Verify all existing styling works correctly after refactoring
  - [x] Test edge cases like transparent backgrounds, zero borders, inherit font-family
  - [x] Ensure email export still generates correct inline styles

**Impact**: Centralizes style object construction, reduces code duplication, and ensures consistent styling behavior across all email blocks.

### Phase 6: Advanced Layout Systems

#### 27. Image Resizing Functionality

- [ ] Create image resizing controls in `src/app/designs/[id]/components/inspector-sidebar/property-controls/image-controls.tsx`
- [ ] Add width and height input controls for images with number inputs (px values)
- [ ] Implement aspect ratio preservation toggle - when enabled, changing width automatically adjusts height to maintain image proportions
- [ ] Add preset size options: small (200px), medium (400px), large (600px), and custom size input
- [ ] Create aspect ratio lock/unlock toggle button with visual indicator (chain link icon)
- [ ] Implement "Fit to container" option that sets width to 100% and height to auto

- [ ] Add container-specific styling controls: background colors, borders, padding, margins
- [ ] Implement visual indicators when hovering over containers during drag operations
- [ ] **Normal block editing within containers**: Double-clicking any block inside a container should select it for editing/styling/dragging, just like blocks outside containers
- [ ] **Update BlockList component** - Show hierarchical tree structure with indentation for container children
- [ ] **Update BlockListItem component** - Add expand/collapse functionality and proper indentation for nested blocks
- [ ] **Enhanced drag-and-drop** - Support dragging blocks into/out of containers within both canvas and block list
- [ ] Ensure email client compatibility with proper HTML structure and inline styles

**Notes**: Focus on intuitive editing where blocks inside containers behave exactly like standalone blocks when selected. Users should be able to seamlessly edit, style, and move blocks regardless of their container status.

#### 29. Grid Block System

- [ ] Create `src/app/designs/[id]/components/email-blocks/grid-block.tsx` - Advanced grid layout component
- [ ] Implement grid system using Row and Column from @react-email/components

- [ ] Enable drag-and-drop of blocks into specific grid cells
- [ ] Add separate horizontal (columnGap) and vertical (rowGap) spacing controls
- [ ] Create responsive grid system that works across email clients
- [ ] Add grid cell management: add, remove functionality
- [ ] Implement grid templates (2x2, 3x1, 1x3, etc.) for quick layouts
- [ ] Add visual grid guidelines and cell highlighting during editing

**Notes**: This is an advanced layout system that requires careful implementation for email client compatibility. Focus on using @react-email/components Row and Column as the foundation. Test thoroughly across Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, and Yahoo.

### Phase 7: Mobile & Final Polish

#### 30. Mobile Home Page

- [ ] Create responsive home page that works on mobile
- [ ] Convert sidebar navigation to mobile-friendly format

**Notes**: Mobile users should see designs but be directed to desktop for editing.

#### 31. Animation Polish

- [ ] Implement subtle hover effects on interactive elements
- [ ] Add smooth state transitions (theme, view modes, selections)
- [ ] Add loading states and micro-interactions

**Notes**: Keep animations subtle and performance-focused. Enhance UX without being distracting.

#### 32. Final Polish and Testing

- [ ] **Enhance user experience**:
  - [ ] Prevent submission of invalid values to block properties
  - [ ] Show helpful validation messages (e.g., "Must be valid hex color like #FF0000")
  - [ ] Add input format hints and examples in placeholders
  - [ ] Implement debounced validation to avoid excessive error messaging

**Impact**: Improves user experience by preventing invalid inputs and providing immediate feedback. Ensures only valid CSS values are used in email blocks, preventing rendering issues.

### Phase 8: Future Features

#### 34. Undo/Redo System

- [ ] Implement robust undo/redo history stack system
- [ ] Add undo/redo buttons to Actions component with proper disabled states
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl + Z (undo), Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z (redo)
- [ ] Save history for all operations: block add/remove/edit/move/duplicate, bulk editing
- [ ] Handle debouncing for rapid text edits to avoid saving every keystroke
- [ ] Ensure history captures intermediate states correctly (e.g., text changes should undo to previous text, not delete block)
- [ ] Limit history stack to reasonable size (50 entries) with proper cleanup
- [ ] Test undo/redo works correctly for all block operations and property changes

**Notes**: This is a complex feature that requires careful state management. Focus on getting core functionality working first before implementing this advanced feature.

#### 35. Subtle Framer Motion Animations

- [ ] Add framer-motion back to dependencies: `pnpm add framer-motion`
- [ ] Implement very subtle hover effects on interactive elements (buttons, block cards, etc.)
- [ ] Add smooth state transitions for theme switching and view mode changes
- [ ] Polish drag-and-drop with gentle feedback animations (scale, opacity changes)
- [ ] Add subtle modal/dialog entrance and exit animations
- [ ] Implement smooth loading states and micro-interactions
- [ ] Add gentle layout animations for block reordering and selection changes

**Notes**: Focus on performance and subtlety. Animations should enhance UX without being distracting or impacting performance. Use transform and opacity changes primarily, avoid animating layout properties when possible.
